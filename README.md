## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The purpose of this project was twofold:
1. Learn the basics of 3d rendering/WebGL.
2. Implement a basic scene graph structure, like that seen in Unity.

TODO: Explain rendering at a high level.
TODO: Explain scene graphs at a high level.

The core of this engine starts with `GameObject`, a class that represent a single object within the scene. Each `GameObject` houses a collection of `GameComponent`s, which define the behavior of the object (e.g. movement).

For more information on scene graphs, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXoGR5pobG4) would be a good place to start. [This article](https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-scene-graph.html) on [webglfundamentals.org](https://webglfundamentals.org) is also great if you're more familiar with matrix math.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
None! This was all done in vanilla JavaScript!

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

1. Download the repo onto your computer.
2. Create an HTML file named `index.html`.
3. Include all the relevant scripts in `index.html`:
```HTML
<script src="models.js"></script>
<script src="transform.js"></script>
<script src="gl-matrix-min.js"></script>
<script src="webgl-utils.js"></script>
<script src="render-utils.js"></script>
<script src="game-component.js"></script>
<script src="lights.js"></script>
<script src="rotator.js"></script>
<script src="camera.js"></script>
<script src="mesh-renderer.js"></script>
<script src="game-object.js"></script>
<script src="rendering-engine.js"></script>
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Add notes about how to use the system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
The demo scene is simply being hosted through GitHub Pages, which is reliant on there being a file named `index.html` in your repository.

- Hat tip to anyone whose code was used
- [@BennyQBD](https://github.com/BennyQBD)'s [YouTube tutorials](https://youtu.be/L19dBX53M5M?list=PLEETnX-uPtBXP_B2yupUKlflXBznWIlL5) on making a Java-based 3d engine were a major source of inspiration for my own engine's structure.
